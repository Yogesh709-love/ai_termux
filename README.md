### AI Command-Line Assistant for Termux & Linux

> **"The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear."**

**Tool Name:** HCO Matrix  
**Code by:** Azhar • HCO Team  
**Channel:** Hackers Colony Tech

HCO Matrix is a colorful command-line AI assistant designed to run in
**Termux on Android** and on **Linux**.

It connects your terminal to an AI model through the OpenRouter API, allowing
you to ask questions, understand Linux/Termux commands, get coding help, and
learn cybersecurity concepts directly from the command line.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

HCO Matrix is an educational technology project.

Use this tool and any AI-generated commands responsibly and only on systems,
networks, accounts, and devices that you own or have explicit permission to
test.

## 🔐 API KEY SECURITY

**NEVER put your real API key inside `ai.py` or commit it to GitHub.**

HCO Matrix reads the API key from an environment variable:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

Your API key stays on your machine and is not included in this repository.

If an API key is accidentally exposed, revoke it immediately and generate a
new one.
